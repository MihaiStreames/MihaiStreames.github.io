excerpt: My late-night adventure setting up this Jekyll blog and the inevitable troubleshooting that followed.
---
## Hi

At this very late hour, I decided to make my own blog, cause why not?

It took me several minutes before figuring out how [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) worked:

```bash
paru ruby
```

```bash
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```

I never used Ruby before, but thankfully I won't have to (for now at least)

```bash
WARNING: You don't have /.../.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin in your PATH, gem executables (jekyll) will not run.
```

```bash
set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths /.../.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin
```

Should be good to go:

```bash
jekyll new notesbymihuu
```

```bash
<internal:/usr/lib/ruby/3.4.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:136:in 'Kernel#require': cannot load such file -- erb (LoadError)
from <internal:/usr/lib/ruby/3.4.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:136:in 'Kernel#require'

from /.../.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin/jekyll:25:in '<main>'
```

Jekyll apparently needs `erb` which wasn't included in the base Ruby package.

Quick fix:

```bash
paru ruby-erb
```

and FINALLY:

```bash
cd notesbymihuu
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Now about me

I'm someone **who enjoys tinkering with technology** and **figuring out how things work**, as you can probably tell from my setup process above.

**Most of my time** is spent either **studying or programming**, but my **main passion** is **making music**. I believe in learning by doing, which often leads to these kinds of late-night adventures where I decide to do random things such as this very blog.

I started this to document my learning journey and **share the random things I discover** along the way. Whether it's a tricky technical problem I solved, a cool piece of code I wrote, or literally anything interesting, I might write about it here.

If any of my posts help you solve a problem or learn something new, that would make me really happy.
